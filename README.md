# Install

## Via Pip
You can install the library using pip:

```
pip install daft-scraper
```

## Via Git
The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), so you'll need poetry to install the dependencies and setup the project.

```
git clone git@github.com:TheJokersThief/daft-scraper.git
cd daft-scraper
make install
```

# Example Usage

```python
from daft_scraper.search import DaftSearch, SearchType
from daft_scraper.search.options import (
    PropertyType, PropertyTypesOption, Facility, FacilitiesOption,
    PriceOption, BedOption
)
from daft_scraper.search.options_location import LocationsOption, Location

options = [
    PropertyTypesOption([PropertyType.APARTMENT]),
    FacilitiesOption([Facility.PARKING, Facility.SERVICED_PROPERTY]),
    LocationsOption([Location.SWORDS_DUBLIN]),
    PriceOption(0, 1000),
    BedOption(1, 4),
]

api = DaftSearch(SearchType.RENT)
listings = api.search(options)

print(len(listings))
for listing in listings:
    print(listing.get('title'))

```

# Using the CLI

The CLI is included as an easy way for me test things and get some quick results :) Let me know if you have any suggestions!

To install the CLI, clone the repo and install the dependencies with `make install`.

```
$ poetry run daft search --max-pages 1 property-for-rent --location cork --location galway
     id    price  title                                                                    propertyType    url
